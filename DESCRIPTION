Description: This library offers tools to analyze nucleotide recoding sequencing data
	generated by experimental techniques like TimeLapse-seq (TL-seq), SLAM-seq, or TUC-seq. 
	These tools include functions specific to TL-seq data processing as well as statistical
	model implementations that should be generally useful for analyzing these experiments. 
	The statistical analyses include kinetic parameter estimation (e.g., RNA degradation rate
	constants) as well as significance probability comptuation and hypothesis testing, which
	can be fed into downstream bioinformatics resources to perform GSEA or other biologically
	motivated investigations. Both efficient, ad hoc statistical modeling as well as rigorous, 
	computationally intensive statistical modeling is implemented, as well as hybrid approaches.
	This library is meant as a resource for anyone trying to get the most out of their enrichment-
	free metabolic labeling high-throughput sequencing experiments.
