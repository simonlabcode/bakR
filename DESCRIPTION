Description: 'bakR' (short for Bayesian analysis of the kinetics of RNA) 
	consists of several implementations of a novel Bayesian hierarchical statistical model of nucleotide 
	recoding RNA-seq experiments (NR-seq; TimeLapse-seq, SLAM-seq, TUC-seq, etc.) for analyzing and
	comparing NR-seq datasets. NR-seq is a powerful extension of RNA-seq that provides
	information about the kinetics of RNA metabolism (e.g., RNA degradation rate constants), which
	is notably lacking in standard RNA-seq data. The statistical model makes maximal use of these
	high-throughput datasets by sharing information across transcripts to significantly
	improve uncertainty quantification and increase statistical power. 'bakR' includes a maximally
	efficient implementation of this model for conservative initial investigations of datasets. 'bakR 
	also provides more highly powered implementations using the probabilistic programming language
	Stan to sample from the full posterior distribution. 'bakR' performs multiple-test 
	adjusted statistical inference with the output of these model implementations to 
	help biolgists separate signal from noise. Methods to automatically visualize key 
	results and detect batch effects are also provided.
