Description: Several implementations of a statistical model of nucleotide recoding
	RNA-seq (NR-seq; TimeLapse-seq, SLAM-seq, TUC-seq, etc.) for analyzing and
	comparing NR-seq datasets. The statistical model makes maximal use of these
	high-throughput datasets by sharing information across transcripts to significantly
	improve uncertainty quantification. 'bakR' performs multiple-test adjusted
	statistical inference with the output of this model to help biolgists separate 
	signal from noise. Methods to automatically visualize key results and detect 
	batch effects are also provided.
