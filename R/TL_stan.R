#' Bayesian hierarchical mixture model with Stan for TL-seq data analysis
#'
#' \code{TL_stan} analyzes nucleotide recoding sequencing data with a fully
#' Bayesian hierarchical model implemented in the PPL Stan. The models estimate
#' fraction news as well as changes in kinetic parameters, comparing a single reference
#' sample to each experimental sample provided.
#'
#' Two general models can be implemented in TL_stan: a full nucleotide recoding model and
#' a hybrid model that takes as input results from \code{fast_analysis}.
#' In the full model, U-to-C mutations are modeled as coming from a Poisson distribution
#' with rate parameter adjusted by the empirical U-content of each feature analyzed. Features
#' represent whatever the user defined them to be when constructing the bakR data object.
#' Typical feature categories are genes, exons, etc. Hierarchical modeling is used to pool data
#' across replicates, across features, and across datasets. More specifically, replicate data for the
#' same feature are partially pooled to estimate feature-specific mean fraction news and uncertainties.
#' Feature means are partially pooled to estimate dataset-wide mean fraction news and standard devitaitons.
#' The replicate variability for each feature is also partially pooled to determine an experimental
#' condition-wide mean-variance relationship between read depths and replicate variability. Partial pooling
#' reduces subjectivity when determining priors by allowing the model to determine what priors should have
#' been set. Partial pooling also regularizes estimates, reducing estimate variability and thus increasing
#' estimate accuracy. This is particularly important for replicate variability estimates, which often rely
#' on only a few replicates of data per feature and thus are typically highly unstable.
#'
#' The hybrid model inherits the hierarchical modeling structure of the full model, but reduces computational
#' burden by foregoing per-replicate-and-feature fraction new estimation and uncertainty quantification. Instead,
#' the hybrid model takes as data fraction new estimates and approximate uncertainties from \code{fast_analysis}.
#' Runtimes of the hybrid model are thus often an order or magnitude or more shorter than with the full model, but
#' loses some accuracy by relying on point estimates and uncertainty quantification that is only valid in the
#' limit of large dataset sizes (where the dataset size for the per-replicate-and-feature fraction new estimate is the raw number
#' of sequencing reads mapping to the feature in that replicate).
#'
#' Users also have the option to save or discard the Stan fit object. Fit objects can be exceedingly large (> 10 GB) for most
#' nucleotide recoding datasets. Therefore, if you don't want to store such a large object, a summary object will be saved instead,
#' which greatly reduces the size of the output (~ 1-10 MB) while still retaining much of the important information. In addition,
#' the output of \code{TL_stan} provides the estimates and uncertainties for key parameters (L2FC(kdeg), kdeg, and fraction new)
#' that will likely be of most interest. That being said, there are some analyses that are only possible if the original fit object
#' is saved. For example, the fit object will contain all of the samples from the posterior collected during model fitting. Thus,
#' new parameters (e.g., L2FC(kdeg)'s comparing two experimental samples) not naturally generated by the model can be estimated
#' post-hoc. Still, there are often approximate estimates that can be obtained for such parameters that don't rely on the full
#' fit object. One analysis that is impossible without the original fit object is generating model diagnostic plots. These include
#' trace plots (to show mixing and efficient parameter space exploration of the Markov chains), pairs plots (to show correlations
#' between parameters and where any divergences occurred), and other visualizations that can help users assess how well a model
#' ran. Because the models implemented by \code{TL_stan} are extensively validated, it is less likely that such diagnostics will be helpful,
#' but often anomalies on your data can lead to poor model convergence, in which case assessing model diagnostics can help you
#' identify the source of problems in your data. Summary statistics describing how well the model was able to estimate each parameter
#' (n_eff and rhat) are provided in the fit summaries, but can often obscure some of the nuanced details of model fitting.

#' @export
#' @param data_list List to pass to Stan of form given by cBtoStan
#' @param Hybrid_Fit Logical; if TRUE, Hybrid Stan model that takes as data output of fast_analysis is run.
#' @param NSS Logical; if TRUE, models that directly compare logit(fn)s are used to avoid steady-state assumption
#' @param keep_fit Logical; if TRUE, Stan fit object is included in output; typically large file so default FALSE.
#' @param chains Number of Markov chains to sample from. 1 should suffice since these are validated models
#' @param ... Arguments passed to `rstan::sampling` (e.g. iter, chains).
#' @return A list of objects:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item Effects_df; dataframe with estimates of the effect size (change in logit(fn)) comparing each experimental condition to the
#'  reference sample for each feature. This dataframe also includes p-values obtained from a moderated t-test. The columns of this

#'   \item ses; Uncertainty in effect size
#'   \item XF; Original feature name
#'  }
#'  \item Kdeg_df; dataframe with estimates of the kdeg (RNA degradation rate constant) for each feature, averaged across replicate data.
#'  The columns of this dataframe are:
#'  \itemize{
#'   \item Feature_ID; Numerical ID of feature
#'   \item Exp_ID; Numerical ID for experimental condition
#'   \item kdeg; Degradation rate constant posterior mean

#'   \item XF; Original feature name
#'  }
#'  \item Fit_Summary; only outputted if keep_fit == FALSE. Summary of Stan fit object with each row corresponding to a particular
#'  parameter. All posterior point descriptions are descriptions of the marginal posterior distribution for the parameter in that row.
#'  For example, the posterior mean is the average value for the parameter when averaging over all other parameter values.
#'  The columns of this dataframe are:
#'  \itemize{
#'   \item mean; Posterior mean for the parameter given by the row name
#'   \item se_mean; Standard error of the posterior mean; essentially how confident the model is that what it estimates to be the
#'   posterior mean is what the posterior mean actually is. This will depend on the number of chains run on the number of iterations
#'   each chain is run for.
#'   \item sd; Posterior standard deviation
#'   \item 2.5%; 2.5th percentile of the posterior distribution. 2.5% of the posterior mass is below this point
#'   \item 25%; 25th percentile of the posterior distribution
#'   \item 50%; 50th percentile of the posterior distribution
#'   \item 75%; 75th percentile of the posterior distribution
#'   \item 97.5%; 97.5th percentile of the posterior distribution
#'   \item n_eff; Effective sample size. The larger this is the better, though it should preferably be around the total number of
#'   iterations (iter x chains). Small values of this could represent poor model convergence
#'   \item Rhat; Describes how well separate Markov chains mixed. This is preferably as close to 1 as possible, and values higher
#'   than 1 could represent poor model convergence
#'  }
#'  \item Stan_Fit; only outputted if keep_fit == TRUE. This is the full Stan fit object, an R6 object of class `stanfit`
