```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.dim = c(6, 4)
)
```

## Necessary Setup

Install and load bakR to run the code in this vignette; instructions on how to do so can be found at this [link](https://simonlabcode.github.io/bakR/index.html). Also, you'll want to set the seed so as to ensure the results you get reproduce those presented in the vignette. 

```{r setup}
library(bakR)
set.seed(123)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
